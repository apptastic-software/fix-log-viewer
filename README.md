Download the installer for Windows, Linux and MacOS from [Releases][1].

### Note for MacOS users
Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of **MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)** and **10.15 (Catalina)** mean that the operating system will show an error message ('"FIX Log Viewer" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Bin.') when trying to install the application. To work around this, run the following command in a terminal before installing:

`sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FIX\ Log\ Viewer.app`
