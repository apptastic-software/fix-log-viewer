## Installation

[![Windows](/assets/windows.png)](https://github.com/apptastic-software/fix-log-viewer/releases/latest) [![Linux](/assets/linux.png)](https://github.com/apptastic-software/fix-log-viewer/releases/latest) [![Mac](/assets/mac.png)](https://github.com/apptastic-software/fix-log-viewer/releases/latest)

Download the installer for Windows, Linux and MacOS from [Releases][1].

### Note for MacOS users
Changes to the security model used in the latest versions of **MacOS 11 (Big Sur)**, **MacOS 12 (Monterey)**, and **MacOS 13 (Ventura)** mean that the operating system will show an error message ('"FIX Log Viewer" is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Bin.') when trying to start the application. To work around this, run the following command on the downloaded dmg file in a terminal **before** installing:

`sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine FIX.Log.Viewer-<version>_<arch>.dmg`

Alternatively download the app from command line with `wget` or `curl` instead of from a web browser. The web browser will flag `.dmg` file as suspicious if it does not have the correct signature. This flag is removed with the above `xattr` command.

I you still see the error message manually remove the app and install it again.
